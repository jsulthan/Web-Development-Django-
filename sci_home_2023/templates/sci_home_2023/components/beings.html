                    Intelligent systems of interest in the industry and peopleâ€™s life such as, 
                    decision making, autonomous systems, autonomous moving systems, content generation, control systems,
                     question answering, knowledge discovery, investigation of bodies of knowledge/data, are modeled, architectured,
                      and implemented as systems comprising at least one state navigator, in which the systems will respond 
                      in various forms in response of an input query or set of data in which a machine or a system changes its 
                    state from a current state to a next or a future state. Methods are given to enable the systems to navigate 
                    through spaces either physical spaces and/or a state space.</p>
