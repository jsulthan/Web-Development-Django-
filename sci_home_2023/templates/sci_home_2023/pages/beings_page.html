                humans are able to do. Using the foundation technology of Science Counter, a consistent product of autonomous intelligent beings is created.
                <br><br>
                Current intelligent systems, and autonomous/automated machines in particular, using current machine learning technologies, are still lacking an efficient, robust, sane, interpretable, 
                explainable, and dependable operations and navigation in physical or data/state/decision spaces.
                <br><br>
                Therefore, there is a need to enhance the art of artificial intelligence in general and, for instance, autonomous navigation in particular, with more robust, dependable, efficient, and 
                interpretable methods than the current machine learning technologies. 
                <br><br>
                In this disclosure we introduce novel concepts, formulations, algorithms, systems and framework/s to make knowledgeable machines which are implemented in several embodiments to make 
                machines of higher utilities without the shortcomings of the current machine learning and artificial intelligence practices and technologies. An example of this would be enable and 
                build knowledgeable mobile machines capable of making autonomous decisions which are rational, stable, interpretable, predictable, and can navigate through space and places.
                <br><br>
                Moreover, according to one or more embodiments of current disclosure, intelligent systems and activities of interest in the industry and peopleâ€™s life such as, decision making, autonomous 
                systems, autonomous moving systems, content generation, control systems, question answering, knowledge discovery, investigation of bodies of knowledge/data, are modeled and implemented as 
                systems. They comprise at least one state navigator, in which the systems will respond in various forms in response to an input query or set of data in which a machine or a system changes 
                from a current state to the next state. Methods are given to enable the systems to navigate through spaces either physical spaces and/or a state space.
