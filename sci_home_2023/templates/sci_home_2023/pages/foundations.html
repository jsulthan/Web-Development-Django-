                When it comes to AI we almost always compare AI to humans. However, there are a whole lot to discover outside of the human-centric universe and yet there is a much bigger universe that human beings 
                (as one instance of an intelligent beings) is only a significant part of it. Very often we try to build an AI based on limited understanding of human perceptions and phenomenological experience of human 
                beings without realizing that there should be grander theory or underlying rules that human exhibition of intelligence is only an instance of its manifestations
                <br><br>
                SCI's grand theory of intelligence states that all intelligent behaviours are instances of state navigation and sequence of events in which one or more of the members of state components are changed, 
                therefore, something new (i.e., an event) has happened which is consistent with rules of physics in the real world. What is intelligence? Oxford Languages defines intelligence as the "ability to acquire 
                and apply knowledge and skills". To understand this definition, we need to answer a few questions about knowledge. Where does knowledge come from and how is it acquired? What is the relationship between 
                knowledge and information? In SCI's theory, knowledge is extracted from information, and information is the significance of data. Acquiring, extracting, and learning real world knowledge from available 
                bodies of data in the universe creates a Body of Knowledge (BOK) in any given universe. <br>
