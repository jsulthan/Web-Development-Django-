                    outside of the realm of the physical universe. Consequently, there should be expected that the intelligence should arise from 
                    following certain mechanisms yet to be discovered. In other words, intelligence should have some principles and rules from which 
                    intelligence behaviour are manifested and exhibited.</p><br>

                  <ol>
                      <li>
                      1.	<strong>Usability testing.</strong> Does your user know how to exit out of screens? Can they follow your intended user journey and buy something from the site you’ve designed? By running a usability test, you’ll be able to see how users will interact with your design once it’s live;
                      </li>
                      <br>
                      <li>
                      2.	<strong>Involving stakeholders.</strong> Need to check if your GDPR consent boxes are displaying properly? Pass your prototype to your data protection team and they can test it for real;
                      </li>
                      <br>
                      <li>
                      3.	<strong>Impressing a client.</strong> Prototypes can help explain or even sell your idea by providing your client with a hands-on experience;
                      </li>
                      <br>
                      <li>
                      4.	<strong>Communicating your vision.</strong> By using an interactive medium to preview and test design elements, designers and developers can understand each other — and the project — better.
